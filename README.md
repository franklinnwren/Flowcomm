code for "Learning Correlated Communication Topology in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning" experiment in multiagent particle world
for the amended cooperative navigation task "simple_spread_local" and "simple_spread_hetero"
here, we use MAAC (Iqbal, et al) as our base algorithm
to run the code, first install the MPE in the particle_env folder, type shell command pip install -e .
then, in the base directory, use python main.py simple_spread_local maac
